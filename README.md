# Neovim Config (Lazy)

Neovim configuration written from scratch. 
Adapting my old config to newer, better practices.

This is the second time I'm remaking the configuration and this one is based on Lazy (after I realized how awesome it it)

## Requirements

- Neovim ^9.0.0
- NodeJS ^16.18.0
- Cmake ^3.31.0
- [Nix Package Manager](https://nixos.org/download/#nix-quick-install)
